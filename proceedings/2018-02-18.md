Following Topics discussed related to the outreach activities of FSUG tvpm.
Website
It would be nice to have a proper website for FSUG.
So that our activities can be archived properly. our achievements can be recorded, and the website can be used for outreach activities.
An FAQ section in the website can be maintained to address the newbie questions about FOSS.
A Ticketing in website will be useful in giving help to new memebers of the group. today, all the knowledge we generate as part of team work is lost in the chatrooms/ groups.
events can be communicated to the public more effectively.

Aswin will enquire the possibility of College of engineering giving FSUG a server to host the said website.

Events
We should be able to hold events periodically. and make record of them so that we can document our work. and the new people will know we are an active group.

It would be nice if we can have atleast one event per month. on a fixed day, like first sunday for example.

Following ideas were proposed for events. feasibility has to be discussed by the community.
Good quality Training classes on various topics. This can be a paid event. we can generate fund for activities of FSUG like this. 
GIT classes can be handled by aswin / gokul
Talks / Discussions about freedom and open source
Exibit gaming capability of Linux
Exhibit examples of open hardware (drones already available with ICFOSS)
Conduct Install fest
Conduct surveys - for the community to understand one on one, how much people know / care about FOSS, and as an opportunity to spread the word and invite people to the group. Also, the survey data can be analysed and used later on. 
related to this, it was observed, that the existing notice we have on FOSS, even though good, needs to be redone to a format where the message is quickly delivered.
